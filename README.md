# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis and Customer Satisfaction Prediction 

## Introduction

In this Academic Project:
1. I would like to show some descriptive analysis of 'Olist Store' from Brazil. This data contains 100k orders information.
These analysis made by orders, geolocation, payments, seller, and products datasets. The aim of this project is finding the Top 10 products and sellers, analysis of orders by their geolocation and obtain information about Brazilian's online e-commerce profiles. 

2. we will develop and compare different ML algorithm for to predict customer satisfaction based on their reviews.The goal of this section is to analyze what makes up satisfaction and disappointment. We will not focus on review scores prediction but rather on discovering where to take actions for increasing customer satisfaction. We Ô¨Årst try to understand which features are relevant to determine the review score.

## Future Work

1. Dataset preprocessing must be improved further to produce better result.

2. Using only the top best important features with algorithm can improve model performance

3. Use different parameter with different values can also improve the model performance in future
